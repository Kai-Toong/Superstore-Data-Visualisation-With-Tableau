# Superstore-Data-Visualisation-With-Tableau
This project will explore an EU Superstore sample dataset that can be found on Tableau Public website. This project will also create a variety of visualisations using Tableau to uncover insights and trends within the data. These visualizations will then be compiled into a comprehensive dashboard, which will summarize the key findings. 

The visualisations can be found in the "Superstore Visualization With Tableau.pdf" file. Alternatively, you can visit this project with the link below which I have uploaded on my Tableau Public account: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kai.toong.ho/viz/SuperstoreVisualizationWithTableau/Dashboard
