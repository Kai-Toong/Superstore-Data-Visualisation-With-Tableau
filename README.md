# Superstore-Data-Visualisation-With-Tableau
This project will explore an EU Superstore sample dataset that can be found on Tableau Public website. Using Tableau, a variety of visualisations will be created to uncover insights and trends within the data. These visualizations will then be compiled into a comprehensive dashboard, which will summarize the key findings. 

The visualisations can be found on the "Superstore Visualization With Tableau.pdf" file. Alternatelively, you can visit this project with the link that I have uploaded on my Tableau Public account: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kai.toong.ho/viz/SuperstoreVisualizationWithTableau/Dashboard
